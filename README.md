This is my Personal Website 

It can be found [here](https://eric-rodriguez.pages.dev/)

This website is made using NextJS and with components from [shadui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

If by chance you'd like to try to run the website on your local system:
1. Clone this repo 
2. Run the command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result!

I will keep on improving my skillset with NextJS, so I'll be sure to add any cool stuff that I learn to this website. I'll also keep on adding more stuff as I work on more projects and art!
